# Regression-Model-2
This is a regression model based on normal equation algorithm.
This model predicts the output of a given input based on given training data set.


# Requirements
Python3
Numpy
Pandas
Matplotlib.pyplot


# About
Normal equation doesnot need to calculate the minimum cost on multiple step just like gradient descent. It can calculate minimum cost in one swoop with its matrix multiplication system. But as we know matrix multiplication takes at best ~ O(n3). So its preferable over small set of data not big set.

Currently tested on windows10.
